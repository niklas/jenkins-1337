Jenkins 1337
============

I personally prefer dark terminals with bright text. I want to pick out
chracters instead of glancing into a blending light.

Use this stylesheet with the "Simple Theme" plugin for jenkins. You must host
this file somewhere, github raw does serve the file as text/plain and the
browser will ignore it.

Patches welcome :-)
